# auto-outfit

Generate a cute outfit with code. You'll never have nothing to wear again!

## How to run:

1. Clone this project with `git clone https://github.com/kelseymakesthings/auto-outfit.git`
2. `cd auto-outfit`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run with `python3 generate_outfit.py`. To see the optional arguments you can include, run `python3 generate_outfit.py --help`

This comes pre-loaded with clothing from my closet. To customize, replace `closet.json` and pictures in `images/` with your own closet!
